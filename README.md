# What is Kalam

I needed a live preview of Pandoc text while writing, something like [Mou.app](http://mouapp.com) but for Pandoc (and not plain Markdown) so that it is easy to [work on my books](http://www.swaroopch.com/blog/byte-of-python-pandoc/), so I hacked this up.

# How to run

1. Install [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) command
2. Fetch this repository, perhaps using the "Zip Download" button
3. Run the node-webkit command with this app folder: `nw kalam`
